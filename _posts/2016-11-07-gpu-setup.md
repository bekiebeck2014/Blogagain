2 key notes during the whole setup:        

2.1 must download and install the latest version of gtx1060 drive, or you maybe get some error during "system check" of cuda installation.

2.2 VS CE can be free downloaded. Also you can install VS2013 on Win10 although Win10 is not in supporting list.
      
you should choose custom type installation as some components are not installed by default.
