花花祝属于我俩的节日快乐。

希望小年糕的妈妈和小年糕健康，快乐。

最后，分享来自花花最爱的Oscar Wilder的作品：


To My Wife by Oscar Wilde

With a Copy of My Poems

I can write no stately proem
As a prelude to my lay;
From a poet to a poem
I would dare to say.

For if of these fallen petals
One to you seem fair,
Love will waft it till it settles
On your hair.

And when wind and winter harden
All the loveless land,
It will whisper of the garden,
You will understand.





你的大年糕
