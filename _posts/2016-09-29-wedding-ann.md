花花，节日快乐。

希望小年糕的妈妈和小年糕健康，快乐。

让我们分享来自于花花最爱的Oscar Wilder的一首诗：


**To My Wife by Oscar Wilde**

With a Copy of My Poems

I can write no stately proem  
As a prelude to my lay;  
From a poet to a poem  
I would dare to say.  

For if of these fallen petals  
One to you seem fair,  
Love will waft it till it settles  
On your hair.  

And when wind and winter harden  
All the loveless land,  
It will whisper of the garden,  
You will understand.  
  
  
  
  




你的大年糕
